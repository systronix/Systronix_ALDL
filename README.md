# Systronix_ALDL
Arduino library and examples for the GM OBD1, ALDL connector used from 1982-1995. My interest is specific to the 1989 Z51 Corvette with TPI and L98 5.7L engine.
[Here is a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IktK0uSnfpJTHYq9ilfAqPVX6r9YkI5P5Y-6UcKTTmk/edit?usp=sharing) with information relevant to my specific ALDL interests. I'll be using a Teensy 3.2 and ILI9341 color touchscreen since we have those at hand. See the Google doc for links to ALDL references: I won't duplicate that here.
